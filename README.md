### Hello World

I'm Mah, web developer with a focus on React and Django, looking to make the world a better place and always trying to learn new things and better myself in the process. I'm currently working on projects for MPRJ, including parquet-digital a web app that is meant to facilitate prosecutor's job by highlighting the most important data and automating a lot of the processes needed to unburden their workload, and it has recently won a prize! If you want to contact me to ask questions or maybe colaborate on something, feel free, I don't bite.
